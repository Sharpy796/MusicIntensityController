# Noita Music Intensity Controller
This mod allows the music in each biome to automatically play in the background. You can adjust the intensity in the mod settings. NOTE: 0% does NOT mean the music will never play, it just means the music will try to stay quiet in calm moments. If you don't want the background music at all, turn your music volume all the way down in audio settings.
